#### Steps
##### Direct Checkout
1. Get Authentication Token
2. Validate Customer Information.
3. Initiate Transaction

##### Hosted Checkout
1. Get Authentication Token
2. Initiate Transaction on Payfast Page.

The Direct Checkout and Hosted checkout credentials can be obtained from <a href="https://gopayfast.com/">Payfast</a> The following are direct checkout methods that can be used with PCIDSS certified websites. You can read more about how to initiate Hosted checkout on <a href="https://github.com/zfhassaan/payfast/wiki/Understanding-the-Hosted-Checkout-Process-for-Payfast">this</a> wiki page

##### What is PCI DSS Certified.
PCI certification ensures the security of card data at your business through a set of requirements established by the PCI SSC. These include a number of commonly known best practices, such as: Installation of firewalls. Encryption of data transmissions, use of anti-virus software. In addition businesses must restrict access to cardholder data and monitor access to network resources.

PCI-compliant security provides a valuable asset that informs customers that your business is safe to transact with. Conversely, the cost of noncompliance, both in monetary and reputational terms, should be enough to convince any business owner to take data security seriously.

A data breach that reveals sensitive customer information is likely to have severe repercussions on an enterprise. A breach may result in fines from payment card issuers, lawsuits, diminished sales and a severely damaged reputation.

After experiencing a breach, a business may have to cease accepting credit card transactions or be forced to pay higher subsequent charges than the initial cost of security compliance. The investment in PCI security procedures goes a long way toward ensuring that other aspects of your commerce are safe from malicious online actors.

##### Hosted Checkout 
The Hosted checkout requires to follow following steps;
1. Get Authentication Token from Payfast
2. Create signature with md5 standard `md5($merchant_id.':' . $merchant_name.':'.$amount.':'.$order_id)`
3. Create Payload for website. The website payload will look something like this: 

```php 
...
...
$backend_callback = "signature=".$signature."&order_id=".$order_id;
...
...
$payload = array(
            'MERCHANT_ID' => $merchant_id, // Merchant ID received from Payfast
            'MERCHANT_NAME' => $merchant_name, // Merchant Name registered with Payfast.
            'TOKEN' => $ACCESS_TOKEN, // Access Token received from Payfast.
            'PROCCODE' => 00, // status code default is 00
            'TXNAMT' => $amount, // Transaction Amount or total amount
            'CUSTOMER_MOBILE_NO' => $mobile, // Customer Mobile Number
            'CUSTOMER_EMAIL_ADDRESS' => $email, // Customer Email address
            'SIGNATURE' => $signature, // Signature as described in above step 2.
            'VERSION' => 'WOOCOM-APPS-PAYMENT-0.9', // Optional
            'TXNDESC' => 'Products purchased from ' .$merchant_name, // Transaction Description to show on website
            'SUCCESS_URL' => urlencode($successUrl), // Success URL where to redirect user after success
            'FAILURE_URL' => urlencode($failUrl), // Failure URL where to redirect user after failure
            'BASKET_ID' => $order_id, // Order ID from Checkout Page.
            'ORDER_DATE' => date('Y-m-d H:i:s', time()), // Order Date 
            'CHECKOUT_URL' => urlencode($backend_callback), // Encrypted Checkout URL
        );
		

```
